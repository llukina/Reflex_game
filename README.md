# Reflex_game
Android game for testing reflexes.

Game creates circles on random coordinates, and the point of the game is to destroy as much circles as possible by tapping on them before they disappear. Game starts with 3 lifes, for each new level player gets another life. If player misses the circle, or the circle disappeares, player loses one life. Every time that player loses a life, game plays a sound. For every miss, player loses some points (depending on a point multiplier). Point multiplier and he speed of circles increases for every level.
